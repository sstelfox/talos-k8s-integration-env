# This patch is for bare metal clusters or clusters where all the control nodes are on the same
# layer 2 network. It uses ARP announcements to simultaneously allow multiple hosts to act as
# living endpoints for the control services on a specific chosen IP. This is a minimal way to get
# HA working on the control plane but BGP should be preferred.
