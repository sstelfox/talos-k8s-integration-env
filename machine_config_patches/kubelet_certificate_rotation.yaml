# Enable rotation of initial certificates to ones signed by the cluster CA. This is a tricky task as
# its a manual task to approve the certificates by default. There is an auto-approver container that
# can be run and I might do temporarily but I'd prefer to manually approve the certificates...
#
# This is needed for at a minimum the metrics server

    # This is specifically the piece that I don't want, but I need to figure out how to manually
    # approve the kubelet certificates during the automated deployment.
