# Enabling this may cause regular tripping of client rate limiting with the default values as each
# service announced increases the number of messages for all hosts. Make sure to read the notes and
# update rate limit calulcations accordingly.

  # The theorhetical shortest time between failure and failover is
  # $leaseDuration - leaseRenewDeadline$ and the longest
  # $leaseDuration + leaseRenewDeadline$. These values also have an impact on the client rate limit
  # later on which should be taken into account.
  #
  # Since this is for the management domain and our administrators can wait a few seconds when this
  # happens I've turned down the defaults here to have a lower impact on the API. We'll have a
  # recovery time with these settings betwen 10-20 seconds.

# Our management services get explicit addresses so they're predictable upon cluster bring up and
# consistent among our different clusters. We need to turn them on to make use of them.
externalIPs:
  enabled: true

# The guide recommends estimating new "normal" query limits using the equation:
#
# $QPS = #services * (1 / leaseRenewDeadline)$
#
# I suspect this isn't quite right as the leaseDuration probably has a larger impact than the renew
  # deadline on the number of messages and seems to be overlooked by the authors...
#
# Only our management services are going to be using this announcement type so they're not reliant
# on the BGP routing plane. I've limited this IP range to 30 addresses and we'll use one service
# per IP for simplicity. This gives us an upper bound on our services for this calculation as 30.
#
# This gives us a rate of $30 * (1 / 5) = 6$. We're below the defaults which are listed below so
# I'm going to leave them as is.
