# The `init` stage is intended to be pre-argocd with these resources eventually being inherited by
# ArgoCD. To do this we need to strip out the managed-by=Helm labesl automatically added by this
# rendering mechanism. I've found two ways to strip out the managed-by helm labels that both seem
# to selectively work in different selections. One of these should be chosen for the chart.

# Strip out all Helm-related labels so resources can be cleanly adopted by ArgoCD
