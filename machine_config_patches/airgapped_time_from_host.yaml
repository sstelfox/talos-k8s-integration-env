  # By default Talos will use Cloudflare's time servers which are not available in the airgapped
  # environment. Our virtual machine hosts already have a finely synced clock and we can make use
  # of that without any additional network traffic. This may have the added benefit of a faster
  # boot as we won't have to wait for the network time source to connect and stabilize.
  #
  # I'm not sure if this device is made available in our qemu test environment yet but we should
  # test that and if not see if we can patch talosctl's behavior to include a PTP clock source when
  # it creates the QEMU VMs.
